Graceful degradation and service workers are related because both concepts aim to enhance the usability of web applications under different conditions. Graceful degradation focuses on ensuring that a web application remains functional even if some more advanced features fail or are unsupported, by providing another solutions. Service workers contribute to this by enabling offline capabilities and improving performance through caching, thereby ensuring that core functionalities of the application remain accessible when network connectivity is poor or unavailable. These both help maintain a positive user experience with potential technical limitations.
